ipof
----
ipof is a very small utility to print the IPv4 address of an interface.

	$ ipof en1
	10.0.1.2

For ease-of-use in provisioning scripts, it does not print a newline.


Using with Teleport and Rackspace Cloudservers
----------------------------------------------
Cloudservers have two interfaces: eth0 and eth1, which represent your public
and private network connections, respectively. Bandwidth between Cloudservers
in the same datacenter ("ServiceNet") is completely free, not to mention
quite a bit faster. For this and security reasons, it's advantageous to run
things like memcached and database servers on internal IPs only. But when
spinning up servers, you might have to end up hand-editing config files after
the fact to get this to work, which defeats a lot of the point of
disposability.

The lowest common denominator is to set a few environment variables whenever
Teleport runs, which can then be used in Teleport ERB templates (e.g. config
files), Makefiles, shell scripts, and from programs directly.

Everything below is relative to your Teleport root.

1. Check out ipof so it will end up in /opt/ipof:

	mkdir -p files/opt/ipof
	git clone git://github.com/eksdyne/ipof.git files/opt/ipof

2. Create a similar directory to hold an environment init script:

	mkdir -p files/opt/env_init

3. Paste this script into files/opt/env_init/env_init.sh:

	#!/bin/sh

	touch /etc/environment
	echo PUBLIC_IP=$(ipof eth0) >> /etc/environment
	echo PRIVATE_IP=$(ipof eth1) >> /etc/environment
	echo PUBLIC_HOST=$(hostname) >> /etc/environment
	echo PRIVATE_HOST=$(hostname).internal >> /etc/environment

Remember to chmod +x it so it'll run.

4. Create a default environment file in files/etc/environment:

	PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games"
	# IP and Host variables follow:

env_init.sh will populate the rest.

5. In your Telfile:

	after_files do
		run 'make -C /opt/ipof install'	# install ipof if needed
		run '/opt/env_init/env_init.sh'	# init env vars
	end

6. All done. You can now use $(PUBLIC_IP), $(PRIVATE_IP), $(PUBLIC_HOST) and
$(PRIVATE_HOST).
